    "text": "About Us\nThe Geotechnical Student Organization (GSO) is a student-run organization at the University of Maine for undergraduate and graduate students interested in geotechnical engineering. We focus on hands-on learning, professional development, and building a strong, supportive community.\nGSO provides opportunities beyond the classroom through workshops, technical seminars, field experiences, and collaborative events. These activities help students connect theory with practice, learn new tools and methods, and gain exposure to real-world geotechnical applications.\nWe emphasize professional connection and community building by bringing together students, faculty, and industry professionals. Through collaborations with organizations such as COPRI and the Geo-Institute of ASCE, GSO supports student participation in conferences, workshops, and competitions while fostering an inclusive, low-pressure environment for learning and connection."
